# Prometheus Metrics Exporter

## Description

PME is a simple application to scrape values from JSON or HTML HTTP endpoints and push metrics to a prometheus 
pushgateway.
The application might come in handy e.g. when:
- your scrape targets are behind a NAT firewall and cannot be reached from the outside by your prometheus instance.
- for some reason you cannot or will not set up a prometheus client on the systems you wish to monitor.

The tool is neither a service nor a daemon. If you want continuous export of metrics, deploy a container with a CRON
job executing the binary.

Currently PME supports following prometheus instruments:
 - counter
 - gauge

There are currently no plans on adding support for the reamining instruments.

Values can be extracted from JSON by
[dot-notation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/12.2/adjsn/simple-dot-notation-access-to-json-data.html#GUID-7249417B-A337-4854-8040-192D5CEFD576)
or from HTML by [XPath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XPath).

## Command line flags

- basicAuth (optional) : information for authentication with the specific scrape target (Documented below)
- mimeType: the content type of the scrape url. JSON and HTML are supported.
- jobName: the job name to display in the pushgateway.
- timeoutInSecs: the time to wait for response from the scrape target before timing out.
- metrics: a list of metrics to pull from the scrape target response. (Documented below)
- labels: a list of labels for the current job. (Documented below)

### BasicAuth (optional)

- username: the basic auth username
- password: the basic auth password

### Metrics

- name: the name for the instrument.
